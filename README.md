Grocery Store CNN


📋 Overview
This project develops a product classification system for grocery store shelves using CNNs, aiding customer assistance and visually impaired individuals.

🎯 Objectives
Single Product Classification: Identify products from images.
Optimization: Improve performance by fine-tuning ResNet-18.
🖼️ Image Preprocessing
Resizing & Cropping: Images scaled to 224x224 px.
Data Augmentation: Flip, rotation, and color jitter for robustness.
🧩 Initial Model
The GroceryModelFull, inspired by VGG, includes:

3 convolutional blocks with pooling.
Global Average Pooling to reduce complexity.
🔬 Ablation Study
Variations tested to assess model components:

NoBN: Without Batch Normalization.
LessChannels: Reduced channels.
LessConvs: One convolution per block.
LessBlocks: Only two convolutional blocks.
🔥 Fine-Tuning ResNet-18
The pre-trained model was adapted to GroceryStoreDataset in two stages:

Initial Fine-Tuning with the best parameters from Part 1.
Further Adjustments to achieve 80%-90% accuracy.
🔧 Optimizations
FC with Dropout (0.3) to reduce overfitting.
Batch size reduction (64 → 32) for increased variability.
📊 Results
These adjustments improved model generalization, achieving the target validation accuracy.
